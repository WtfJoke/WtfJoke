## Welcome to my profile :wave:

My name is Manuel. I've been a Software Developer for quite a while and enjoy the aesthetics of nicely written software.

Furthermore, I love open-source software and appreciate each one, who contributes. :dancers:

### Pins
In my pins, you can find repositories, which I'm in one way or another proud of (some are contributions and some are just projects I did) ðŸ˜ƒ


**Happy coding!** :ghost:
